    # You can define waypoints as either Pure Pursuit waypoints with a radius, or just the waypoint itself for GoToPosition or GVF.
    # Normal Pose waypoints can be defined either explicitly:
    # {"x":6.0,"y":6.0,"heading":0.10471975511965978}
    #
    # or referencing a pose/point in the "globals" Konfig file:
    # hors()
    #
    # or a pose in the "globals" Konfig file:
    # &pose1
    #
    # ---
    # When defining headings, use the "deg(20.0)" function to convert the heading from degrees -> radians:
    # {"pose": {"x": 14.0, "y": 6.0, "heading": deg(20.0)}, "radius": 20.0}
    # ---
    # Pure Pursuit waypoints can be defined using:
    # {"pose": {"x": 14.0, "y": 6.0, "heading": 14.0}, "radius": 20.0}
    # {"point": {"x": 14.0, "y": 6.0}, "radius": 20.0}
    #
    # You can use the "&" syntax similarly in Pure Pursuit waypoints as we did before.
    # {&pose1, "radius": 20.0}
    # {&point1, "radius": 20.0}
    #
    # ---
    # Actions can be defined either as a Pure Pursuit ActionWaypoint or just referencing an action definition.
    # They can be defined as the following:
    # *action_id
    #
    # For pure pursuit, you may NOT have an action waypoint start your path, and you must have a POSE to end your path.
    # ---
    # Start your path below!
